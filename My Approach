Two different approaches of how I scraped data from the Instagram-pages

First Approach) Inspect Instagram-Website -> Accesbility -> Copy the username list
Second Approach) Manually copy the following users by the list
-> all collected usernames get pasted into Excel

Command into Chat-GPT: transform this list into a list like this: username (Real Name)

Paste the results into Excel again

Manually decide if F/M by name
