Home/First Page
1. Instagram API to directly search for the player's Instagram
1.2. a list of elite ballers to search for (linking with sofifa, https://sofifa.com/)
1.2. also linking with Transfermarkt (https://www.transfermarkt.com/), from the player's Transfermarkt-Site you can often see their Instagram

2. enter Instagram-URL of the Instagram-Profile into a bracket that should be analyzed

3. programm will automatically scrape the data and also make an seperate .xlsx-file available for further use

4. an analysis of scraped following-list will be done by an AI (if you want to)
